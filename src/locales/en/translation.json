    },
    "questions": {
      "q1": "What is the purpose of converting my tokens?",
      "a1": "Converting your tokens into TigerOG removes the transaction tax (often 10-12%) associated with the legacy token. It also allows you to bridge these tokens to other blockchains like Ethereum, Base, and more via Axelar, enabling access to new ecosystems.",
      "q2": "Is it safe to use Freedom Bridge?",
      "a2": "Yes. The protocol uses a secure Conversion contract and Axelar's Interchain Token Service. When you convert, your BNBTiger is permanently burned and you receive TigerOG at a 1:1 ratio. The burn mechanism ensures the total supply is properly managed across all chains.",
      "q3": "Are there any fees?",
      "a3": "Freedom Bridge itself does not charge a fee for converting. You only pay standard blockchain gas fees. Bridging between chains involves a cross-chain gas fee paid to Axelar to cover the relaying costs.",
      "q4": "What happens if I lose my tokens?",
      "a4": "TigerOG tokens behave like any other ERC20/BEP20 token. If you lose access to your wallet, they cannot be recovered. Always keep your private keys and recovery phrases secure.",
      "q5": "Can I convert my TigerOG tokens back to BNBTiger?",
      "a5": "No. Conversion is one-way. When you convert BNBTiger to TigerOG, your legacy tokens are permanently locked in the conversion contract. This is by design — TigerOG is the upgraded, tax-free version meant to replace the legacy token entirely.",
      "q6": "Which networks are supported?",
      "a6": "We support multiple EVM chains via Axelar, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, Base, and more. Check the Wiki for the full list of supported networks.",
      "q7": "How long does bridging take?",
      "a7": "Bridging time depends on which chain you're sending FROM:\n\n• Ethereum: 15-20 min (needs more confirmations)\n• BSC & Avalanche: 2-4 min (fastest)\n• Base, Linea, Polygon: 3-5 min\n\nThe app shows the estimated time before you bridge.",
      "q8": "What are the circulating supplies of the OG tokens?",
      "a8": "Each OG token has a fixed circulating supply derived from its original BNB token, accounting for burned tokens, stuck contract balances, and locked LP:\n\n• TigerOG: ~3.66 septillion (36.62% of original)\n• LionOG: ~3.83 septillion (38.33% of original)\n• FrogOG: ~8.39 septillion (83.86% of original)\n\nSee the Wiki for detailed breakdowns.",
      "q9": "Why isn't the OG contract renounced?",
      "a9": "Renouncing the contract would remove the ability to develop and add new chains in the future. While the contract will not be renounced for the foreseeable future, multiple signatures are required to make any changes. Also, no tokens or taxes are allocated to the team.",
      "q10": "Why is the OG contract mintable?",
      "a10": "Cross-chain bridging requires mint/burn functionality - tokens are burned when leaving a chain and minted when arriving. This keeps total supply constant across all networks. Minting is controlled by a multisig Safe wallet.",
      "q11": "Is TigerOG leaving BNB Chain for Axelar?",
      "a11": "No. Axelar is not a blockchain - it's the bridging protocol that connects chains together. BNB Chain remains the origin chain where you convert legacy tokens. Axelar simply enables your tokens to move between BNB, Ethereum, Base, and other supported networks.",
      "q12": "Where are my tokens?",
      "a12": "Make sure you add the chain and token address to your wallet. You can find all contract addresses on the Contracts page. The Tiger team uses Rabby wallet which makes managing multiple chains easier.",
      "q13": "Why is bridging from Ethereum or Base taking so long?",
      "a13": "Ethereum requires two epochs before finalizing transactions for maximum security. Since Base settles on Ethereum, it inherits this delay. This prioritizes security over speed - your tokens are safe, just be patient.",
      "q14": "What happens if I stay in my original token and don't convert?",
      "a14": "There is no rush to convert. BNBTiger and TigerOG will always have different liquidity pools, market caps, and so on. But BNBTiger has a high tax and TigerOG has no tax for trading. Since the taxes on the original aren't used to support the project, development is done by the CTO team for TigerOG. Freedom Bridge and multi-chain is only for TigerOG.",
      "q15": "Is there a tax to convert? Does TigerOG have a tax?",
      "a15": "No. It only costs the normal gas fee to convert and trade. There are no additional taxes or fees, and TigerOG is a tax-free contract.",
      "q16": "Can I just buy and trade TigerOG directly?",
      "a16": "Not yet. The team hasn't collected fees and taxes to be able to fund large enough liquidity pools. To get TigerOG now, you have to buy or already own the original and convert. Once you own TigerOG, it won't be easily traded until investors come to add to the liquidity pool.",
      "q17": "Why does the TigerOG market cap look so inflated?",
      "a17": "The smaller a liquidity pool, the more any small trade makes a huge impact on the displayed market cap. This resolves once investors come to be liquidity providers.",
      "q18": "What security audits have been done?",
      "a18": "Freedom Bridge has not undergone a formal third-party audit. However, the converter contract code is based on the SHx converter built by the Stronghold team (former XRP and Stellar developers who recently presented at Davos). The bridging infrastructure is powered by Axelar, which has undergone multiple security audits.",
      "q19": "How does Freedom Bridge protect against hacks or exploits?",
      "a19": "Several measures are in place:\n\n• The converter only holds the exact circulating supply needed - no excess tokens that could be exploited\n• The converter has no mint permissions\n• All contract code is verified on-chain and open source\n• Token permissions are secured in a Safe.global multisig wallet\n• Bridging is handled by Axelar's battle-tested infrastructure",
      "q20": "Is bridging irreversible? What if a transfer fails?",
      "a20": "Bridge transfers can rarely get stuck due to insufficient gas or network congestion. If this happens, you can track your transaction on Axelarscan and manually add gas to complete it. Axelar provides transaction recovery tools - you won't lose your tokens.",
      "q21": "What are the risks associated with using Freedom Bridge?",
      "a21": "As with any DeFi protocol, there are inherent risks including smart contract risk, bridge risk, and market volatility. We recommend doing your own research (DYOR) and only using funds you can afford to lose. See our legal disclaimer for more information.",
      "q22": "Can I convert the new BNB Tiger Inu contract (September 2025)?",
      "a22": "No. Freedom Bridge supports the original/legacy BNB Tiger token that launched several years ago - not the new contract created in September 2025. Freedom Bridge was built for the community takeover (CTO) of the original Tiger, Lion, and Frog tokens.",
      "q23": "How do I add liquidity?",
      "a23": "Adding liquidity is an advanced DeFi activity with risks including impermanent loss. If you're experienced with providing liquidity on DEXs like PancakeSwap or Uniswap, the process is the same - pair the OG token with a base asset. Here's a great educational series on liquidity if you want to learn more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiylIHvwMik&list=PL_ujg_v1hZ5iGtiuhT8NkSMqEOaLAgmUu",
      "q24": "Can the team rug pull?",
      "a24": "No. There is no mechanism for a rug pull. No tokens or taxes are allocated to the team, and we don't collect any bridging fees — those go to Axelar for relaying costs. The team are holders just like you, building this at personal expense. The only team wallet is a public marketing wallet funded by community donations. The multisig Safe wallet controls contract permissions such as pausing sending to chains in case of emergency, but cannot access or redirect user funds."
