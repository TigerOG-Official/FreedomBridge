      "q6": "Which networks una dey support?",
      "a6": "We dey support many-many EVM chains via Axelar, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, Base, and more. Check the Wiki for the full list of supported networks.",
      "q7": "How long bridging dey take?",
      "a7": "Bridging speed depend on which chain you dey sending FROM:\n\n• Ethereum: 15-20 min (need more confirmations)\n• BSC & Avalanche: 2-4 min (fastest)\n• Base, Linea, Polygon: 3-5 min\n\nThe app show the estimated time before you bridge.",
      "q8": "Wetin be the circulating supplies of the OG tokens?",
      "a8": "Each OG token get fixed circulating supply wey come from its original BNB token, accounting for burned tokens, stuck contract balances, and locked LP:\n\n• TigerOG: ~3.66 septillion (36.62% of original)\n• LionOG: ~3.83 septillion (38.33% of original)\n• FrogOG: ~8.39 septillion (83.86% of original)\n\nCheck the Wiki for detailed breakdowns.",
      "q9": "Why OG contract no dey renounced?",
      "a9": "Renouncing the contract go remove the ability to develop and add new chains for future. While the contract no go dey renounced for foreseeable future, multiple signatures dey required to make any changes. Also, no tokens or taxes dey allocated to the team.",
      "q10": "Why OG contract dey mintable?",
      "a10": "Cross-chain bridging require mint/burn functionality - tokens dey burned when leaving a chain and minted when arriving. This keeps total supply constant across all networks. Minting dey controlled by a multisig Safe wallet.",
      "q11": "TigerOG dey leave BNB Chain for Axelar?",
      "a11": "No o. Axelar no be blockchain - na bridging protocol wey dey connect chains together. BNB Chain remain the origin chain where you convert legacy tokens. Axelar simply enable your tokens to move between BNB, Ethereum, Base, and other supported networks.",
      "q12": "Where my tokens dey?",
      "a12": "Make sure say you add the chain and token address to your wallet. You fit find all contract addresses for the Contracts page. The Tiger team dey use Rabby wallet which makes managing multiple chains easier.",
      "q13": "Why bridging from Ethereum or Base dey take so long?",
      "a13": "Ethereum require two epochs before finalizing transactions for maximum security. Since Base settle on Ethereum, e inherit this delay. This prioritizes security over speed - your tokens dey safe, just exercise patience.",
      "q14": "Wetin happen if I stay for my original token and no convert?",
      "a14": "No rush to convert. BNBTiger and TigerOG go always get different liquidity pools, market caps, and so on. But BNBTiger get high tax and TigerOG no get tax for trading. Since the taxes on the original no dey used to support the project, development is done by the CTO team for TigerOG. Freedom Bridge and multi-chain na only for TigerOG.",
      "q15": "Tax dey to convert? TigerOG get tax?",
      "a15": "No o. E only cost the normal gas fee to convert and trade. No additional taxes or fees, and TigerOG na tax-free contract.",
      "q16": "I fit just buy and trade TigerOG directly?",
      "a16": "Not yet. The team never collect fees and taxes to fit fund large enough liquidity pools. To get TigerOG now, you have to buy or already own the original and convert. Once you own TigerOG, e no go dey easily traded until investors come to add to the liquidity pool.",
      "q17": "Why TigerOG market cap look so inflated?",
      "a17": "The smaller a liquidity pool, the more any small trade make huge impact on the displayed market cap. This resolves once investors come to be liquidity providers.",
      "q18": "Which security audits dem don do?",
      "a18": "Freedom Bridge never undergo formal third-party audit. However, the converter contract code base on the SHx converter wey Stronghold team build (former XRP and Stellar developers wey recently present for Davos). The bridging infrastructure dey powered by Axelar, wey don undergo multiple security audits.",
      "q19": "How Freedom Bridge protect against hacks or exploits?",
      "a19": "Several measures dey in place:\n\n• The converter only hold the exact circulating supply wey needed - no excess tokens wey fit exploited\n• The converter no get mint permissions\n• All contract code verify on-chain and open source\n• Token permissions dey secured in a Safe.global multisig wallet\n• Bridging dey handled by Axelar's battle-tested infrastructure",
      "q20": "Bridging fit reverse? What if transfer fail?",
      "a20": "Bridge transfers fit rarely get stuck due to insufficient gas or network congestion. If this happen, you fit track your transaction for Axelarscan and manually add gas to complete am. Axelar provide transaction recovery tools - you no go lose your tokens.",
      "q21": "What are the risks associated with using Freedom Bridge?",
      "a21": "As with any DeFi protocol, inherent risks dey including smart contract risk, bridge risk, and market volatility. We recommend make you do your own research (DYOR) and only use funds wey you fit afford to lose. See our legal disclaimer for more information.",
      "q22": "I fit convert the new BNB Tiger Inu contract (September 2025)?",
      "a22": "No o. Freedom Bridge support the original/legacy BNB Tiger token wey launch several years ago - not the new contract created in September 2025. Freedom Bridge build for the community takeover (CTO) of the original Tiger, Lion, and Frog tokens.",
      "q23": "How I fit add liquidity?",
      "a23": "Adding liquidity na advanced DeFi activity with risks including impermanent loss. If you get experience with providing liquidity on DEXs like PancakeSwap or Uniswap, the process be the same - pair the OG token with a base asset. Here's a great educational series on liquidity if you wan learn more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiylIHvwMik&list=PL_ujg_v1hZ5iGtiuhT8NkSMqEOaLAgmUu",
      "q24": "Team fit do rug pull?",
      "a24": "No o. No mechanism dey for rug pull. No tokens or taxes allocated to the team, and we no collect any bridging fees — those go to Axelar for relaying costs. The team na holders just like you, building this at personal expense. The only team wallet na public marketing wallet funded by community donations. The multisig Safe wallet controls contract permissions such as pausing sending to chains in case of emergency, but cannot access or redirect user funds."
