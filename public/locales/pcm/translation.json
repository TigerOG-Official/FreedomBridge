      "q2": "E safe to use Freedom Bridge?",
      "a2": "Yes. The protocol dey use secure Migration contract and Axelar's Interchain Token Service. When you convert, your BNBTiger dey burn forever and you receive TigerOG at 1:1 ratio. The burn mechanism ensure say total supply dey properly managed across all chains.",
      "q3": "Any fees dey?",
      "a3": "Freedom Bridge itself no dey charge fee for changing am. You only pay the standard blockchain gas fees. Bridging between chains involve cross-chain gas fee wey you pay to Axelar to cover the relaying costs.",
      "q4": "Wetin happen if I lose my tokens?",
      "a4": "TigerOG tokens behave just like any other ERC20 token. If you lose access to your wallet, you no fit recover am. Always keep your private keys and recovery phrases secure.",
      "q5": "I fit change my TigerOG tokens back to BNBTiger?",
      "a5": "No o. The migration na one-way conversion. When you convert BNBTiger to TigerOG, your BNBTiger tokens dey burn forever (sent to the dead address). This one na by design — TigerOG na the upgraded, tax-free version wey dem mean make e replace the legacy token entirely.",
      "q6": "Which networks una dey support?",
      "a6": "We dey support many-many networks via Axelar, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, Base, and more. Check the Wiki for the full list of supported networks.",
      "q7": "How long bridging dey take?",
      "a7": "Bridging speed depend on the finality time of the source chain and Axelar relaying. Usually, transfer between chains dey take about 2-5 minutes.",
      "a8": "Each OG token get fixed circulating supply wey come from its original BNB token, accounting for burned tokens, stuck contract balances, and locked LP.
