    },
    "questions": {
      "q1": "What is the purpose of converting my tokens?",
      "a1": "Converting your tokens into TigerOG removes the transaction tax (often 10-12%) associated with the legacy token. It also allows you to bridge these tokens to other blockchains like Ethereum, Base, and more via Axelar, enabling access to new ecosystems.",
      "q2": "Is it safe to use Freedom Bridge?",
      "a2": "Yes. The protocol uses a secure Migration contract and Axelar's Interchain Token Service. When you convert, your BNBTiger is permanently burned and you receive TigerOG at a 1:1 ratio. The burn mechanism ensures the total supply is properly managed across all chains.",
      "q3": "Are there any fees?",
      "a3": "Freedom Bridge itself does not charge a fee for converting. You only pay standard blockchain gas fees. Bridging between chains involves a cross-chain gas fee paid to Axelar to cover the relaying costs.",
      "q4": "What happens if I lose my tokens?",
      "a4": "TigerOG tokens behave like any other ERC20 token. If you lose access to your wallet, they cannot be recovered. Always keep your private keys and recovery phrases secure.",
      "q5": "Can I convert my TigerOG tokens back to BNBTiger?",
      "a5": "No. The migration is a one-way conversion. When you convert BNBTiger to TigerOG, your BNBTiger tokens are permanently burned (sent to the dead address). This is by design — TigerOG is the upgraded, tax-free version meant to replace the legacy token entirely.",
      "q6": "Which networks are supported?",
      "a6": "We support multiple EVM chains via Axelar, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, Base, and more. Check the Wiki for the full list of supported networks.",
      "q7": "How long does bridging take?",
      "a7": "Bridging speed depends on the source chain's finality and Axelar's relaying. Typically, a transfer between chains takes about 2-5 minutes.",
      "q8": "What are the circulating supplies of the OG tokens?",
      "a8": "Each OG token has a fixed circulating supply derived from its original BNB token, accounting for burned tokens, stuck contract balances, and locked LP. TigerOG: ~3.66 septillion (36.62% of original). LionOG: ~3.83 septillion (38.33% of original). FrogOG: ~8.39 septillion (83.86% of original). See the Wiki for detailed breakdowns of each token."
